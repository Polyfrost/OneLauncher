# # ============= CORE ============= # #

# commands/apis that don't depend on tauri. rather than using the tauri
# event and invoke apis for handling api calling, it creates a router which
# we can easily use with tanstack solid query apis.
# this means we don't have to redefine all our core apis as tauri commands.

# TODO: the api migration is blocked until rspc updates to a newer version of tauri v2.

# it generates rust code into other languages, in our case, typescript.
# v2 is the latest/only version, and it is updated as a release candidate
# on crates.io almost after every commit, so a git dep isn't necessary.
# features: "derive" and "function" are core apis of specta we rely on.
# the remaining features implements the specta::Type trait for their
# respective dependencies of the same name. if we add a new dependency
# and run into specta errors, adding the dependency as a feature will usually solve this.
